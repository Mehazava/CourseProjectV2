    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>   The Albert Vidal Award is a prestigious award, named after the founder of WorldSkills International (formerly known as the International Vocational Training Organisation). During the first thirty-one WorldSkills Competitions (formerly known as the Vocational Training Competitions), Francisco Albert Vidal, from Spain, was responsible for the achievement of the original goals in a changing world: 33 years as an untiring promoter in his position as Secretary General and seven years as President of the International Organisation constantly presenting new ideas. The Vocational Training Competitions became his life's work and the International Organisation was shaped into what it is today. In memory of Albert Vidal, the Award recognises the Competitor that achieves the overall highest score out of all Competitors in all Skill categories.

   The Albert Vidal Award is connected with the implementation of the 500 mark system, developed by former WorldSkills President Cees Beuk, after the WorldSkills Competition 1985 held in Osaka, Japan. The new system was developed upon the request from the Technical Committee Chairman René Gonthier and his vision of making the Competition scores more comparable and universal.

   With the new system, it became possible to compare the scores from skill to skill and from Expert to Expert within each skill, making their scoring behaviour more transparent. The new system became effective in 1988 (when the WorldSkills Competition was held in Sydney, Australia) at which the 'Best of the Competition Award' was introduced for the first time.

   After Albert Vidal’s death in October 1993 the Award was renamed (proposed by Tjerk Dusseldorp, past President, WSI) from the 'Best of the Competition Award' to the 'Albert Vidal Award' in order to honour the contributions of Albert Vidal for his decades of devotion to the WorldSkills movement. The new name of the award, first became effective in 1995 when the WorldSkills Competition took place in Lyon, France. 

   “Fill youth with enthusiasm through special action! Convince young people’s parents, trainers and company chiefs that a promising future is possible only through good vocational training” -Francisco Albert Vida</value>

    <value>   The 1st WorldSkills Competition took place at “Virgen de la Paloma” Vocational Training Institute in Madrid, Spain, in 1950.

   WorldSkills International, formerly known as the International Vocation Training Organisation (IVTO), was founded in the 1940s and emerged from a desire to create new employment opportunities for young people in some of the economies that were devastated by the Second World War.</value>
